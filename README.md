# raspberrypi

## Installing LAMP
This installs apache2, mariadb-server-10.0, php and a vsftp. It copies also the necessary config files.
- Run `sudo bash lamp/install.sh`
- Then you will be prompt to answer if this is a new installation (installs all packages or just update apt-get)
- You will be also promptet to input the ip to connect with your computer with a lan cable (input a 0 to avoid setting an ip)
